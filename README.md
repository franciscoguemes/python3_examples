This project is just a collection of code examples with Python 3. The project is not meant to be a tutorial or a
programming course for beginners, it is more a set of examples on which experienced programmers on other languages can
have an idea on how to achieve specific goals in Python 3.

The code tries to be as intuitive and illustrative as possible. The code examples are numbered in order of difficulty,
like a tutorial/course would do, some of the examples are contained in its own subdirectory since they might be small
apps that are composed of multiple *.py files and additional external resources (images, text files, etc...). In these
cases this mini-project examples might contain its own Readme.md file. For the examples contained in its own file, the
samples might have a comment section at the beginning to explain the purpose of the code snippet is not clear.
