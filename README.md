# Python 3 examples
Learn Python3 by examples.

This project is a collection of code examples in Python 3. The aim of this project is to learn Python 3 language through 
examples and some clarifications in the comments of the examples. The project is not meant to be a tutorial or a
programming course for beginners, it is more a set of examples on which experienced programmers on other languages can
have an idea on how to achieve specific goals in Python 3.

The code tries to be as intuitive and illustrative as possible. The code examples are numbered in order of difficulty,
like a tutorial/course would do. The project is organized in the following directories:

 - __basic__ : The basics of the Python language programming. In this category the examples will be sorted by number starting
           with 000 to 999. These are code examples contained in its own file, the samples might have a comment section 
           at the beginning to explain the purpose of the code snippet is not clear.
 - __intermediate__ : In this category the examples will be divided by topics. In order to ease the search for topics please 
                      try to avoid having sub-topics (sub-directories) inside each topic. Inside each topic order the files
                      with the same criteria as the basic category. Sort each topic (directory) of the intermediate category 
                      by using a number from 00 to 99.
 - __advanced__  : The advance topics can combine one or multiple of basic and intermediate topics. The advance topics will be
                    classified into different directories and inside each topic can be one or multiple sub-topics, but please 
                    try to avoid nesting as much as possible. Use the same criteria for the directories as in the intermediate
                   topics.
 - __projects__ : Small projects that illustrate the concepts learned in the different categories. These projects are contained 
                  in its own subdirectory since they are small apps that are composed of multiple *.py files and additional 
                  external resources (images, text files, etc...). These mini-project examples might contain its own Readme.md 
                  file.
